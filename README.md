# mkFileReplacer
Mario Kart Wii File Replacer, very useful for those using texture hacks but are on dolphin

**Prerequisites**
1. Python
2. For **Run Game** feature to work you need to make Dolphin the default program to run **main.dol** files. Alternatively, you can just drag and drop the main.dol in the sys folder into Dolphin

**HOW TO USE**

1. Extract Mario Kart Wii ISO with program of your choice (Wii Scrubber, WIT etc)
2. Put all texture hacks, custom sounds, custom characters etc into a folder (this will be the equivalent of the My Stuff folder in CTGP)
3. Run the program
